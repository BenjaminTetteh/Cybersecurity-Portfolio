### Conduct a security audit
As part of my Google cybersecurity certificate course, I completed a security audit for Botium Toys, a fictional company. The task involved reviewing the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment, then conducting an internal audit using a controls and compliance checklist. The audit aimed to evaluate the company’s security posture, identify gaps in their current systems, and assess compliance with regulations like PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC standards. The key focus was on asset management, access control, encryption, and data protection practices, with recommendations for improving security controls and regulatory compliance.
